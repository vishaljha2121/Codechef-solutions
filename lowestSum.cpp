    /* The Head Chef is studying the motivation and satisfaction level of his chefs .
    The motivation and satisfaction of a Chef can be represented as an integer .
    The Head Chef wants to know the N th smallest sum of one satisfaction value and one motivation value for various values of N .
    The satisfaction and motivation values may correspond to the same chef or different chefs .
    Given two arrays, the first array denoting the motivation value and the second array denoting the satisfaction value of the chefs .
    We can get a set of sums(add one element from the first array and one from the second).
    For each query ( denoted by an integer qi ( i = 1 to Q ) , Q denotes number of queries ) ,
    find the qi th element in the set of sums ( in non-decreasing order ) . */
